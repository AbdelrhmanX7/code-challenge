# Refactoring the Wallet Component

## Problem Statement

The original implementation of the Wallet component was cluttered, with everything being handled in a single file. This made it challenging to solve issues, debug, and understand the logic.

## Solution Overview

We propose a step-by-step refactoring plan to break down the component into smaller, more manageable parts, improve the readability of the code, and fix any type-related issues.

## Step-by-Step Refactoring

### 1. Organize Files

- **Move Types and Interfaces:**
  Create a new file `types.ts` to store all the types and interfaces in one place. This ensures better maintainability and separation of concerns.

- **Move Utility Functions:**
  Extract the utility functions into a new file `utils.ts`. This keeps the logic separate and reusable across other components or parts of the project.

- **Move JSX to ****`WalletRows.tsx`****:**
  Isolate the JSX code into a dedicated `WalletRows.tsx` file for better modularity and readability.

### 2. Simplify Logic

- **Remove Unused Variables:**
  After reviewing the logic, identify and eliminate any variables that are not being used.

- **Optimize Existing Logic:**
  Refactor overly complex logic into simpler, more concise expressions. This makes the code easier to understand and maintain.

### 3. Create a Custom Hook

- **New Hook:**
  Develop a new custom hook to handle balance formatting. The hook will:
  - Sort the balances.
  - Format them.
  - Return the formatted balances ready for rendering.


### 4. Fix Type Issues

- **Type Checking:**
  After isolating logic, JSX, and utility functions, ensure all types are defined correctly.

- **Refactor Types:**
  Ensure consistency in type usage across all files.

Example:

### 5. Combine

- **Reassemble:**
  Bring all the refactored pieces together to form the updated Wallet component.

## Benefits of Refactoring

- **Improved Readability:**
  By breaking down the component, each part is now simpler and easier to understand.

- **Reusability:**
  Utility functions and types can be reused in other components.

- **Scalability:**
  The codebase becomes more maintainable and scalable for future updates.

- **Performance:**
  Optimized logic ensures better performance, especially with the custom hook.

## File Structure

After refactoring, the project structure should look like this:

```
src/
  components/
    Wallet/
      WalletRows.tsx
  hooks/
    useFormattedBalance.ts
  utils/
    utils.ts
  types/
    types.ts
```
